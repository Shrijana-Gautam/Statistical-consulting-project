Analyzed longitudinal data from 11 UConn womenâ€™s basketball athletes across six season phases. Used LMMs, repeated measures correlation, and LRT in R. Most biomarkers stayed stable, but CPII significantly decreased with higher impact load; post-injury showed a non-significant trend of reduced physical strain.
