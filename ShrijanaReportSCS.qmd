# Introduction

The University of Connecticut (UConn) Women’s Basketball (WBB) team is one of the most competitive team in the United Statesand has won a total of 12 NCAA Division I national championships. The physical demands of players are characterized by high-intensity movements, frequent directional changes, and rigorous training schedules that place significant stress on athletes’ musculoskeletal and physiological systems. Monitoring biomarkers of cartilage turnover and inflammation can offer valuable insights into how athletes respond to these demands over time. In particular, biomarkers such as C2C (collagen type II cleavage), CPII (procollagen II carboxy propeptide), and CS836 (aggrecan chondroitin sulfate 846 epitope) are increasingly recognized for their ability to reflect cartilage degradation and synthesis, and may serve as indicators of physiological stress, injury risk, or recovery.

This study leverages longitudinal data collected from UConn Women’s Basketball players during the 2022–2023 season to investigate changes in the biomarkers across different phases of the athletic year. Data were collected at six key time points— off-season, pre-season, regular season, mid-season, NCAA, and post-season providing a comprehensive view of the athletes’ physiological status across a full competitive cycle. In addition to biomarker data, cumulative mechanical impact load for the week preceding each measurement was recorded, enabling analysis of the relationship between physical stress and biochemical responses.

The overarching goal of this study was to examine the changes in inflammation-related biomarkers over time in women’s basketball players and to assess the impact of injury on load metrics. Specifically, this study will evaluate whether impact load change from pre- to post-injury, how biomarkers fluctuate across the season, and whether biomarker correlations shift over time. Additionally, I will assess the relationship between biomarker levels and cumulative impact load from the preceding week. These findings may help identify injury risk indicators and improve prevention strategies in female basketball athletes.

**Objectives**

The objective of this study is to examine the temporal dynamics of inflammation-related biomarkers and their association with physical load in a cohort of WBB players. Specifically, the study aims to:

a)  Evaluate whether impact load changes significantly from pre- to post-injury

b)  Assess whether biomarker levels vary significantly across different periods of the competitive season

c)  Investigate the correlations among biomarkers and whether these relationships change over the course of the season

d)  Determine whether biomarker values are associated with cumulative impact loads from the week preceding measurement

# Methods

Longitudinal data across six key time points— off-season, pre-season, regular season, mid-season, NCAA, and post-season six time points was collected from 11 WBB athletes for this study. Biomarkers of interest: C2C, CPII, and CS836 were measured at each time point, along with the cumulative impact load in the one-week period preceding the measurement. Given the repeated-measures design and small sample size, I employed Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs; Bates et al., 2015) using the lme4 package and lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) in R (R version 4.4.3) to appropriately account for both fixed effects (time point, injury status) and random effects (athlete-specific variability). This model was used because it is well-suited for unbalanced and incomplete longitudinal data.

To assess whether cumulative impact load significantly differs for pre- and post-injury periods, an LMM was constructed with injury status (pre vs. post) as a fixed effect, accounting for repeated observations from the same individual. To evaluate whether biomarkers change significantly over the season, biomarker type and time point were included as fixed effects, and athlete ID as a random effect, enabling joint modeling of repeated, multi-category responses. Relationships between biomarkers (e.g., C2C vs. CPII) were analyzed using Repeated Measures Correlation (rmcorr), a method that adjusts for intra-individual correlation. To determine whether these associations vary across the season, interaction terms between biomarker values and time points were included in an LMM framework. Finally, to test the association between cumulative impact load and biomarker levels, we modeled biomarker value as the outcome and one-week prior impact load as a continuous fixed effect, again accounting for within-athlete dependencies using random intercepts.For model selection, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was used to compare the goodness-of-fit.

For my data analysis, I used several R packages. I used ggplot2 to make elegant and clear plots (Wickham, 2016). I used lme4 to fit linear mixed-effects models (Bates et al., 2015). I used lmerTest to run tests in these models (Kuznetsova et al., 2017). For data manipulation, I used dplyr (Wickham et al., 2023) and tidyr (Wickham, Vaughan, & Girlich, 2024). These packages are part of the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019). I used gtsummary to create summary tables (Sjoberg et al., 2021). I used janitor to clean my data (Firke, 2024). I used rmcorr to study repeated measures correlation (Bakdash & Marusich, 2024). I used cowplot to improve and annotate my plots (Wilke, 2024). I used sjPlot to make social science visualizations (Lüdecke, 2024).

The Figure 1 displays a bar plot illustrating the number of injuries by location among athletes. The right ankle was the most commonly injured site, with 8 reported cases, followed by the left ankle with 6 injuries and the right knee with 5 injuries. Injuries to the left hip and left knee were much less frequent, with only 1 case each. Overall, ankle injuries (both left and right) accounted for the majority of injury occurrences, highlighting a potential area of concern for prevention efforts.

The histogram (Fig. 3) shows the total timeloss days due to injuries for each WBB athlete, identified by Athlete ID. Athlete No. 6 experienced the greatest timeloss, missing 144 days, followed by Athlete No. 4 with 69 days, Athlete No. 5 with 29 days, Athlete No. 10 with 17 days, and Athlete No. 9 with 3 days. Several athletes, including Athletes# 3, 5 (also recorded with 12 days), 7, 8, and 11, had minimal timeloss ranging from 1 to 4 days. These results highlight considerable variation in injury impact, with Athlete# 6 being the most severely affected.

The Figure 4 presents boxplots of three biomarkers (C2C, CPII, and CS836) measured across six different time points in the athletic season: off-season, pre-season, regular season, mid-season, NCAA, and post-season. Each biomarker is shown in a separate panel with its own y-axis scale to accommodate differences in magnitude. C2C and CPII values appear relatively stable across time points, with some slight fluctuations but no dramatic shifts. CS836 values are generally lower compared to the other biomarkers, with a few notable outliers, particularly during the NCAA time point. The distribution of values for each biomarker remains fairly consistent, suggesting no substantial biomarker changes throughout the athletic season.

**Inferential Analysis**

Objective a. Does impact load change significantly from pre to post injury?

The chart (Fig. 5) compares the pre- and post-injury impact load for WBB athletes, with the duration of timeloss days reflected by the shade of red (darker shades representing longer timeloss). Athletes# 3, 5, 9, 10, and 11 have both pre- and post-injury impact load measurements, indicating that they were able to return to participation after injury. Athlete# 4 exhibited an increase in impact load following their injury. Athlete# 6, who experienced the longest timeloss with 144 days missed, has no post-injury impact load recorded, reflecting their inability to return during the observed period. Similarly, Athletes# 7 and 8 also lack post-injury values, as their injuries occurred during the off-season when no impact load data were collected.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_long <- pre_post %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(pre_impact_load, post_impact_load),
               names_to = "time",
               values_to = "impact_load") %>%
  mutate(
    time = recode(time, 
                  pre_impact_load = "pre", 
                  post_impact_load = "post"),
    time = factor(time, levels = c("pre", "post"))
  ) %>% drop_na(impact_load)

df_long$timeloss_week <- ifelse(df_long$timeloss_days>7, 1, 0)

ggplot(df_long, aes(x = time, y = impact_load, 
                    group = interaction(athelete_id, date), 
                    color = timeloss_week)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +
  labs(
    title = "Pre vs Post Impact Load by Athlete and Time Loss Days",
    x = "Time", y = "Impact Load",
    color = "Timeloss Days"
  ) + facet_wrap(~athelete_id)

```

Figure 5: Pre vs post impact load by athlete and time loss days.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_long$impact_load_scaled <- scale(df_long$impact_load)
model1 <- lmer(impact_load_scaled ~ time  + (1 | athelete_id), data = df_long)


library(sjPlot)
tab_model(model1, show.re.var = FALSE )
```

The linear mixed-effects model suggests that impact load tends to decrease following injury among WBB players, with an average reduction of 0.50 standard deviations at the post-injury time point compared to pre-injury.

While this change is not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level (p = 0.097), it suggests a trend toward reduced physical load following injury. Given the small sample size and repeated measures, this finding should be interpreted with caution but may still be clinically meaningful.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
model1 <- lmer(impact_load_scaled ~ time * timeloss_week + (1 | athelete_id), data = df_long, REML = FALSE)
model2 <- lmer(impact_load_scaled ~ time + timeloss_week + (1 | athelete_id), data = df_long, REML = FALSE)

anova(model2, model1)
```

The interaction between time and timeloss days is not statistically significant (p = 0.18), which means it doesn't add meaningful information to the model. Also, the AIC and BIC values are slightly lower for the simpler model (Model 2), suggesting it fits the data just as well but with fewer variables. So, it's better to keep the simpler model without the interaction, since adding it doesn't improve the results much.

b.  Do biomarkers change significantly over periods of the season?

The graph (Fig. 6) tracks changes in three biomarkers (C2C, CPII, CS836) for female basketball athletes across seasonal time points: off-season, pre-season, regular season (Reg-season), mid-NCAA season (mid-NCAA), and post-NCAA season (post-NCAA).

I ran Linear Mixed-Effects Models to see if the values of each biomarker changed significantly across different parts of the season, using pre-season as the reference group. Each model includes a random effect for athlete ID to account for repeated measures from the same player.

Linear mixed-effects models showed no significant changes in CPII or C2C levels across the season. However, CS836 significantly decreased during the off-season compared to pre-season (p = 0.048). Variability in C2C (ICC = 0.86) and CS836 (ICC = 0.59) was largely attributable to differences between athletes.

```

To compare either simple model or interaction model is best, I used likelihood ratio test. In all case p-value \> 0.05, which means interaction does not add much value so simple model is used for this analysis using 5 % level of significant.

Table 3 summarizes models without interaction terms, examining relationships between different biomarker pairs. In Model 1, C2C was significantly positively associated with CPII (Estimate = 3.22, p = 0.037), suggesting that higher levels of C2C correspond to higher levels of CPII. In contrast, Model 2 showed no significant association between CS836 and CPII (p = 0.310), and Model 3 also indicated no significant relationship between C2C and CS836 (p = 0.919).

d.  Are biomarker values correlated with cumulative impact loads from 1 week prior to measurement?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
biomarker$impact_1w_scaled <- scale(biomarker$impact_1w)
md <- lmer(value ~ impact_1w_scaled + time_point + (1 | athlete_id), data = biomarker)
md1 <- lmer(value ~ impact_1w_scaled * biomarker + time_point + (1 | athlete_id), data = biomarker)
anova(md, md1)
```

The interaction model (md1) fits the data significantly better than the simpler model (md). This means that the relationship between 1-week prior impact load and biomarker values varies significantly across biomarkers.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tab_model(md1, show.re.var = FALSE)
```

The analysis indicates that cumulative impact load from the previous week is not significantly associated with biomarker levels, as shown by a non-significant coefficient (β = -4.24, 95% CI: \[-56.22, 47.74\], p = 0.872). Among the biomarkers, CPII levels are significantly higher compared to the reference biomarker C2C (β = 656.18, 95% CI: \[599.51, 712.86\], p \< 0.001), while CS836 levels are significantly lower than C2C (β = -88.45, 95% CI: \[-145.12, -31.78\], p = 0.003). The interaction terms between impact load and biomarker type are not statistically significant, indicating that the relationship between impact load and biomarker levels does not differ across biomarkers. Additionally, seasonal time points (pre-season, regular season, and post-season) do not show significant effects on biomarker levels after accounting for other variables (Fig. 10).

There is no evidence that cumulative impact load from the previous week affects biomarker levels, either overall or differentially across biomarker types.

**Conclusions**

This study explored the relationship between injury, biomarker dynamics, and physical load among women's basketball (WBB) players using a combination of linear mixed-effects models and repeated measures correlations. While the reduction in impact load post-injury was not statistically significant (p = 0.086), it suggests a potential trend toward decreased physical strain after injury—a finding that, though preliminary, could be clinically relevant and warrants further investigation with larger samples.

Regarding biomarker trends across the competitive season, only baseline differences between biomarkers—particularly significantly higher CPII levels compared to C2C (p \< 0.001) —were observed. No significant changes were detected in biomarker levels across time or in their temporal interaction, indicating limited seasonal variation within the biomarkers under study.

Correlation analyses revealed no significant repeated measures correlations between any pair of biomarkers. Additionally, regression modeling supported a significant positive relationship between C2C and CPII (p = 0.037), but no other pairwise associations were statistically meaningful. Likelihood ratio tests favored simpler models, suggesting interaction terms did not improve model fit.

Finally, cumulative impact load from the prior week showed no significant association with biomarker levels overall. However, biomarker-specific effects were observed: CPII levels decreased significantly with higher impact loads, while no significant associations were found for C2C or CS836. This pattern, combined with the lack of significant interaction terms, suggests that while physical load may influence certain biomarkers like CPII, it does not have a generalized effect across all markers.

In summary, this analysis offers suggestive but not definitive evidence of a post-injury decrease in physical load and highlights stable biomarker profiles across the season. While CPII emerges as a potentially responsive biomarker to physical load, broader conclusions remain limited by sample size and design constraints. Future research with more extensive longitudinal data may help clarify these associations and improve monitoring strategies for athlete health.

Future recommendations: Based on the findings, we recommend that the client continue monitoring post-injury impact load, as the observed decrease, though not statistically significant, may reflect meaningful recovery trends. Biomarkers remained stable over time, suggesting limited utility for tracking seasonal changes; however, CPII stands out as a potentially responsive marker, showing a significant negative association with impact load. Therefore, prioritizing CPII in routine monitoring may offer the most value. Since interactions and time trends were not significant, simpler models are sufficient for ongoing analysis. Overall, we advise using biomarker profiles primarily for between-player comparisons and continuing data collection with a focus on post-injury periods and CPII to strengthen future insights.
